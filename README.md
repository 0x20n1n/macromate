# 🥗 MacroMate

MacroMate is a modern web application designed to help users calculate and track their daily caloric and macronutrient needs based on their individual body metrics and fitness goals.

## 📊 Overview

MacroMate provides scientifically validated formulas (Mifflin-St Jeor and Katch-McArdle) to calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). This allows users to make informed decisions about their nutrition based on personalized data rather than generic recommendations.

- **🧮 Multiple Formula Options**: Choose between Mifflin-St Jeor (general use) or Katch-McArdle (for those tracking body fat)
- **🏃‍♂️ Activity Level Adjustments**: Calculations adapt to your specific activity level
- **💾 Saved Calculations**: Track your progress by saving and reviewing previous calculations
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface with light/dark mode support
